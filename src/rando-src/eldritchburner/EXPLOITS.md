# Exploits solutions

Solutions to the `SF-1` achievements, names and descriptions are located in
<https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src/blob/dev/src/Exploits/Exploit.ts>, and give
clues for each of them. You can also use the GitHub search feature for the token `Exploit.N00dles`
(for example).

## `Exploit.N00dles`: n00dles

Easy: anytime after your first BitNode go to the `n00dles` bar in New Tokyo and eat noodles.

## `Exploit.PrototypeTampering`: prototype tempering

The exploit verify that users didn't change the `Number.toExponential` prototype, and since it is
used only for display purpose, changing it is not impactful. In the developer console copy paste
the following line:

```js
(55).__proto__.toExponential = (55).__proto__.toString
```

Notes:
    - The code has no effect outside of the current session, just reload the page to stop it.
    - The check is done every 15 minutes, so just do it and wait, then save and reload.

## `Exploit.UndocumentedFunctionCall`: undocumented

There are a few NS undocumented function, on of the achievement is the starting point of these.
Create a `exploit.js` file on any server and run it with the following call inside of `main`:

```js
/** @param {NS} ns */
export async function main(ns) {
    ns.exploit()
}
```

## `Exploit.Bypass`: bypass RAM cost

You need to supply the global `document` to the `ns.bypass` function without it costing you any
RAM, the secret sauce here is that the `eval` primitive allow you to get it, and string are
ignored in the RAM computation.

```js
/** @param {NS} ns */
export async function main(ns) {
  ns.bypass(eval(`document`))
}
```

Notes:
    - A lot of things can be done with access the global `document`, have fun in your scripts.

## `Exploit.INeedARainbow`: I need a raibow

This exploit require to call the `ns.rainbow` function with a guess word, if you don't want to
brute force it you would us a **Raibow Table**, ence the name. If you want to try your hands
there is a method to the madness and some clues on discord and in the reddit post in the notes.

Else to brute force it you can make a script like that:

```js
const BRUTEFORCE_PASSWORDS_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/master/Passwords/darkweb2017-top10000.txt"

/** @param {NS} ns */
export async function main(ns) {
  ns.wget(BRUTEFORCE_PASSWORDS_URL, "darkweb2017-top10000.txt")
  let rainbow_list = ns.read("darkweb2017-top10000.txt").split("\n")

  for (let i in rainbow_list) {
    if (i % 100 == 0) await ns.sleep(1)
    if (ns.rainbow(rainbow_list[i])) {
      ns.tprint(`Rainbow Solution: '${rainbow_list[i]}'`)
      return
    }
  }
}
```

Notes:
    - Reddit discussion: <https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitburner/comments/tpnuqo/comment/ih8qdpz>
    - Don't skip on the `await ns.sleep(1)` or else...
